# talks

ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

Thanks for your interest in speaking at Austin DevOps. We collect our talks here, and publish to the [Meetup.com][meetup]. This is just a way to make sure the organizers have visibilty into talk submissions and the ability track where things are using a familiar tool.

Please if you're interested, click [New Issue][issues] and submit your talk!

## Process

1) Fill out the above link to submit the talk you'd like to propose.
2) The card will go to `Proposed` and one of the organizers will make any relevant comments or thoughts on the `issue`.
3) When accepted and updated into Meetup.com, the card will go to `Groomed`.
4) A Day before, or day of, the card will be moved to `In progress`.
5) When completed the card will move to `Done`.
